# SNP Camps

Field medical camp operations: desk registration, presence, clinical fulfilment.

## Language

**Aadhaar Secure QR**:
The dense UIDAI Secure QR printed on a PVC Aadhaar card. This is the primary artefact the desk camera must read.
_Avoid_: Aadhaar QR (ambiguous — also used for e-Aadhaar, mAadhaar, and older XML QRs)

**e-Aadhaar QR**:
The QR on an e-Aadhaar PDF or printout. Fallback artefact, not the optimisation target.
_Avoid_: Aadhaar QR

**mAadhaar QR**:
The QR shown on the mAadhaar app screen. Fallback artefact, not the optimisation target.
_Avoid_: Aadhaar QR

**XML QR**:
The older Aadhaar card QR that encodes XML attributes. Fallback artefact, not the optimisation target.
_Avoid_: Aadhaar QR

**Desk camera**:
The volunteer-held phone camera at the registration desk. Primary capture device for Aadhaar Secure QR.
_Avoid_: patient camera, self-register camera

**Desk phone**:
A volunteer's own Android or iPhone used at the registration desk. Both platforms must read Aadhaar Secure QR.
_Avoid_: camp-issued device, patient phone

**Live scan**:
Reading Aadhaar Secure QR through the desk-camera viewfinder.
_Avoid_: scan (also used for photo upload and USB wedge)

**Guide ROI**:
The centered square on the live-scan preview, about 90% of the video's short edge, where the volunteer holds Aadhaar Secure QR. The first detect looks here at native pixels; a miss uses the full frame next. It is a place to look, not a smaller image.
_Avoid_: qrbox (the old crop that also downscaled)

**Detect**:
The camera found a QR payload. Detect is not Lock.
_Avoid_: Lock, scan, capture

**Soft Hold**:
Live scan pauses the detector while Decode runs on the Detect payload.
_Avoid_: Freeze, pause camera

**Decode**:
The server job (`POST /aadhaar/decode`) that classifies a QR payload as `card`, `garbage`, or `not-aadhaar`. There is no client Aadhaar sniff. Decode happens during Soft Hold, not after Lock.
_Avoid_: parse, client validation

**Lock**:
Decode returned `card`. Live-scan success. Not a saved registration, not a camera Detect.
_Avoid_: scan success, Detect, capture

**Failure**:
Decode returned `garbage` or `not-aadhaar`. Live scan resumes. The same payload is ignored briefly so the camera does not POST it in a loop.
_Avoid_: camera error, Lock

**Freeze**:
On Lock, live scan stops the detector and holds the preview.
_Avoid_: Soft Hold, stop camera (unless the stream is actually torn down)

**Photo upload**:
The volunteer gives the app a still image of the QR; the app reads the QR from the file.
_Avoid_: scan, gallery scan

**USB wedge**:
A hardware scanner that types the QR payload into the page.
_Avoid_: USB scanner as a synonym for desk camera
